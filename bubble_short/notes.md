# Bubble Short
bubble short algorithm will short the given array of numbers in ascending or descending order. <br />
The shorting of numbers will be done by swapping the values if they are in wrong order. <br />

The simple approach is using brute force algorithm where we will use two for loop, First loop will point to one of the starting index the array whereas the second loop will loop throughout the given array when the first loop is still pointing at first index.<br />

As the second loop iterates through all the index we will compare the value with the first loop index, If the order is incorrect we will perform the swap operation between those two index.<br />
